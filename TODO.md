TODO list
---

- Possibly rename World.light_source to World.light to match the book
- Extract a function to add objects to world
- Function to multiply an arbitrary number of matrices together
- Should probably chunk up pixels more for computation. If we have
  schedulers_online chunks of pixels to compute, then we may spend
  more time computing pixels and less time juggling tasks
